			<h2><em>Alice&apos;s Adventures in Wonderland</em>, by Lewis Carroll</h2>
			<p>Alice was beginning to get very tired of sitting by her sister on the bank&comma;
			and of having nothing to do&period; Once or twice she had peeped into the book her
			sister was reading&comma; but it had no pictures or conversations in it&comma; &quot;and what
			s the use of a book&comma;&quot; thought Alice&comma; &quot;without pictures or conversations&quest;&quot;</p>
			<p>So she was considering in her own mind &lpar;as well as she could, for the day made her
			feel very sleepy and stupid&rpar;&comma; whether the pleasure of making a daisy&minus;chain would be
			worth the trouble of getting up and picking the daisies&comma; when suddenly a White Rabbit with pink eyes ran close by her&period;</p>
			<p>There was nothing so very remarkable in that&comma; nor did Alice think it so very much out of the way to hear the Rabbit say to itself&comma; &quot;Oh dear&excl; Oh dear&excl; I shall be too late&excl;&quot;
			But when the Rabbit actually took a watch out of its waistcoat&minus;pocket and looked at it and then hurried on&comma; Alice started to her feet&comma; for it flashed across her mind
			that she had never before seen a rabbit with either a waistcoat&minus;pocket&comma; or a watch to take out of it&comma; and&comma; burning with curiosity&comma; she ran across the field after it and was
			just in time to see it pop down a large rabbit&minus;hole&comma; under the hedge&period; In another moment&comma; down went Alice after it&excl;</p>
