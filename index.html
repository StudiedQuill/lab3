			<h2><em>Alice&apos;s Adventures in Wonderland</em>&comma; by Lewis Carroll</h2>
			<p>Alice was beginning to get very tired of sitting by her sister on the bank&comma;
			and of having nothing to do&period; Once or twice she had peeped into the book her
			sister was reading&comma; but it had no pictures or conversations in it&comma; &quot;and what
			s the use of a book&comma;&quot; thought Alice&comma; &quot;without pictures or conversations&quest;&quot;</p>
			<p>So she was considering in her own mind &lpar;as well as she could, for the day made her
			feel very sleepy and stupid&rpar;&comma; whether the pleasure of making a daisy&minus;chain would be
			worth the trouble of getting up and picking the daisies&comma; when suddenly a White Rabbit with pink eyes ran close by her&period;</p>
			<p>There was nothing so very remarkable in that&comma; nor did Alice think it so very much out of the way to hear the Rabbit say to itself&comma; &quot;Oh dear&excl; Oh dear&excl; I shall be too late&excl;&quot;
			But when the Rabbit actually took a watch out of its waistcoat&minus;pocket and looked at it and then hurried on&comma; Alice started to her feet&comma; for it flashed across her mind
			that she had never before seen a rabbit with either a waistcoat&minus;pocket&comma; or a watch to take out of it&comma; and&comma; burning with curiosity&comma; she ran across the field after it and was
			just in time to see it pop down a large rabbit&minus;hole&comma; under the hedge&period; In another moment&comma; down went Alice after it&excl;</p>

			<h2><em>Peter Pan</em>&comma; by J&period; M&period; Barrie</h2>
			<p>All children&comma; except one&comma; grow up&period; They soon know that they will grow up&comma; and the way Wendy knew was this&period; One day when she was two years old she was playing in a garden&comma; 
			and she plucked another flower and ran with it to her mother&period; I suppose she must have looked rather delightful&comma; for Mrs&period; Darling put her hand to her heart and cried&comma; 
			&quot;Oh&comma; why can&apos;t you remain like this for ever&excl;&quot; This was all that passed between them on the subject&comma; but henceforth Wendy knew that she must grow up&period; 
			You always know after you are two&period; Two is the beginning of the end&period;</p>
			<p>Of course they lived at 14 &lbrack;their house number on their street&rbrack;&comma; and until Wendy came her mother was the chief one&period; She was a lovely lady&comma; with a romantic
			mind and such a sweet mocking mouth&period; Her romantic mind was like the tiny boxes&comma; one within the other&comma; that come from the puzzling East&comma; however many you discover
			there is always one more&semi; and her sweet mocking mouth had one kiss on it that Wendy could never get&comma; though there it was&comma; perfectly conspicuous in the right&minus;hand corner&period;</p>

			<h2><em>The Wonderful Wizard of Oz</em>&comma; by L&period; Frank Baum</h2>
			<p>Dorothy lived in the midst of the great Kansas prairies&comma; with Uncle Henry&comma; who was a farmer&comma; and Aunt Em&comma; who was the farmer&apos;s wife&period; Their house was small&comma;
			for the lumber to build it had to be carried by wagon many miles&period;  There were four walls&comma; a floor and a roof&comma; which made one room&semi;
			and this room contained a rusty looking cookstove&comma; a cupboard for the dishes&comma; a table&comma; three or four chairs&comma; and the beds&period;
			Uncle Henry and Aunt Em had a big bed in one corner&comma; and Dorothy a little bed in another corner&period;  There was no garret at all&comma; and no cellar&minus;&minus;except
			a small hole dug in the ground&comma; called a cyclone cellar&comma; where the family could go in case one of those great whirlwinds arose&comma; mighty enough to crush any building in its path&period;
			It was reached by a trap door in the middle of the floor&comma; from which a ladder led down into the small&comma; dark hole&period;</p>
			<p>When Dorothy stood in the doorway and looked around&comma; she could see nothing but the great gray prairie on every side&period;
			Not a tree nor a house broke the broad sweep of flat country that reached to the edge of the sky in all directions&period;
			The sun had baked the plowed land into a gray mass&comma; with little cracks running through it&period;  Even the grass was not green&comma;
			for the sun had burned the tops of the long blades until they were the same gray color to be seen everywhere&period;  Once the house had been painted&comma;
			but the sun blistered the paint and the rains washed it away&comma; and now the house was as dull and gray as everything else&period;</p>
